Fluid css grid

MON 14/0414

This is my first "real" GitHub repository rhd_DEgs. 

rhd_DEgs 
========

This is my first attempt at a fluid css grid.
I have made my own grid and css classes in my attempt to bring a 
fluid css grid with responsive mobile first web design. 
Basically this relies on a combination of a fluid grid with media 
queries and image percentage scaling.

There are many fluid (and some responsive ) css grids already available 
(eg Unsemantic,Melody grid and many more). 

My code here is heavily based on James Dinsdale's (@molovo)Melody css fluid grid.

Usage
=====

Currently I only have added a basic html5 file eg rhd_DEgs.html.
I plan to add the image and other files necessary for this page to work properly very soon.

Development
===========
rhd_DEgs fluid css grid now begins development by me. Feel free to use it if you wish...

ENJOY! :-)
